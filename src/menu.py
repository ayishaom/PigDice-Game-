ðŸŽ² PIG DICE â€” RULES ðŸŽ²

- Players take turns to roll one die.
- On your turn you may roll as many times as you like.
- Each non-1 roll adds to your turn total.
- If you roll a 1 you lose your turn total and the turn ends.
- You may 'hold' to bank the turn total into your overall score.
- First to reach 100 points wins.
- You may change your name during the game; stats are preserved in high scores.

    
Cheat instructions:

- During your turn, type 'cheat' or 'c' to add +50 points to the current player.
- You can also type 'restart' during a game to reset both players' scores to zero.
- Use 'ai' during your turn to change AI difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
- Type 'name' to change a player's name.
